# frozen_string_literal: true
# makes sure all builds that are needed for a deploy are successfully built
# (needed builds are determined by projects `dockerfiles` column or passed in image list)
#
# Special cases:
# - when no Dockerfile is in the repo and it is the only requested dockerfile (column default value), return no builds
# - if a build is not found, but the project has as `docker_release_branch` we wait a few seconds and retry
# - builds can be reused from the previous release if the deployer requested it
# - if the deploy is cancelled we finish up asap
# - we find builds across all projects so multiple projects can share them
